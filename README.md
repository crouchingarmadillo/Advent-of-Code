# Advent-of-Code
Here I document my submissions to Advent of Code. Comments have been added after submission to improve clarity (including the time and rank) but the code itself remains the original written prior to submission. All solutions are written in Python 3.

## File Structure
The general file structure follows this tree.
- year
  - input
    - day.txt
  - solutions
    - day.py

Here the year is a directory marked with the year (e.g. 2023). The input directory inside stores the puzzle input for each day (e.g. 1.txt). The solutions directory inside stores the solution for each day (e.g. 1.py).
